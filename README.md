Project Name: Soccer Shark

Project Description
Fuelled by my passion for the game, I made a soccer coaching tool that would enable coaches to explain and visualize their game-plans during training sessions to their players.
This program is written is Python 3

To run the project, open the TP3 file and run in VSCode preferrably. I used no modules that need to be installed.
